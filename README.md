<h2># Elementor - Add On Memory Limit Error patch<h2>
<p>This plugin is intended to only be used as a temporary workaround, to make time-sensitive content edits when there are too many add ons for Elementor active, and the memory limit is exceeded causing the builder to continuously load.</p>
THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A LONG TERM SOLUTION || USE ONLY TEMPORARILY FOR TIME SENSITIVE CONTENT EDITING
